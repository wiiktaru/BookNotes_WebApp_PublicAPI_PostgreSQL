# BookNotes_WebApp_PublicAPI_PostgreSQL WORK IN PROGRESS

## Description
Book notes app is a solution created with the Express framework and Node.js, includin PostgreSQL as a database and a public API (https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers). 

With this project I aim to develope understanding of how to integrate database and public API into web projects and how to use Express/Node.js for server-side programming. I practice understanding the database-server and server-client communication. I also practice version controlling for web api. 

Public/Pictures folder has a mainpage.jpg and addnew.jpg files for app demo picture.

## Features
Website shows books retrievet from the database. 
User can add a new book to the database or edit / delete existing book. Edit and delete features are still work in progress. 

## Entry point
The main entrt point of the solution is the index.js file
